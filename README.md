Hi, Welcome to my Machine Learning Projectss repository. This respository contains all my projects related to Machine Learning, showcasing my skills and expertise in the field. Each one of the projects demonstrates and covers each stage of a typical Machine Learning workflow. This includes data cleaning, Exploratory Data Analysis, data preprocessing, data transforming, data normalisation, data visulatisation, model training, performance evaluation, and model selection.

Projects
---------

1. Heart Disease Prediction
   - Description: This project uses heart disease data to predict the chances of a patient developing a heart disease in the next 10 years by being trained on 4 different Machine Learning models to find the one with the highest accuracy.
   - Technologies Used: K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, K-Means, Random Forests are used in this notebook
   - Result: KNN model out-performs the other algorithms with an prediction accuracy of 84.6%.
